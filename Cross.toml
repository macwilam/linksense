# Cross-compilation configuration for LinkSense
# This file configures the `cross` tool for building on different target platforms
#
# The openssl crate is configured with the "vendored" feature, which compiles
# OpenSSL from source during the build. This requires perl and a C compiler,
# which are available in the default cross-rs images.

# All targets use the default cross-rs images which include the necessary
# build tools (C compiler, perl, make) for compiling vendored OpenSSL
