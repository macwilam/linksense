# Cross-compilation configuration for LinkSense
# This file configures the `cross` tool for building on different target platforms
#
# The openssl crate is configured with the "vendored" feature, which compiles
# OpenSSL from source during the build. The default cross-rs images include
# the necessary build tools (C compiler, perl, make).
